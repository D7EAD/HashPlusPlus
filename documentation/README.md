<b>Hash++</b> is a modern C++17 header-only library that provides developers simple means of retrieving cryptographic hashes and keyed-hashed message authentication codes (HMACs) from the algorithm(s) of their choice. The library was developed with the goal of appealing to one particular type of developer--one who does not want to use larger, heavier, or more confusing libraries with unnecessary features to simply hash data.
